# Validation of Video-Derived Wave Height at the Port of Sines, Portugal

## Project Background

This work is part of the ongoing **NEXUS Agenda** project, which focuses on the digital transition and decarbonisation of the Port of Sines, Portugal (NEXUS Agenda, 2023). A key requirement to support these objectives is the accurate estimation of local wave parameters—namely wave height, period, and direction—which are essential for informed decision-making in coastal and harbour operations and management.

Due to the deep bathymetry at the Port of Sines, the installation of hydrodynamic sensors in the nearshore zone is not feasible. As a result, there is a clear need for a cost-effective and reliable alternative to in situ measurements. To address this challenge, a methodology based on UAV imagery was developed to estimate significant wave height (Hs_vid). This approach was validated using ADCP measurements at Figueira da Foz, which served as the reference site. The methodology was subsequently applied at the Port of Sines, where the estimated wave heights were compared with wave model outputs under different sea-state conditions (Hs_M1 to Hs_M2).

Insights and recommendations are presented across three key aspects:

* **Method reliability**: Evaluation of the consistency between video-derived and model-based significant wave heights, identification of detected sea states, and assessment of overall discrepancies.
* **Environmental influence**: Analysis of the effects of environmental factors, such as wind speed, on the estimated wave parameters.
* **Suitability of method application**: Assessment of historical trends to identify periods most suitable for the application of the proposed methodology.

##  Datasets 
Video dataset: In March 2025, 615 video 10-minute datasets were obtained from the installed fixed camera at the Port os Sines, each frame was recorded at 30 frames per second making it a total of 2,880,000 processed frames, the  Extracted from video datasets and converted into a structured dataset following the method (see MATLAB script).
