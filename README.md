# Validation of video-derived Wave height at the Port of Sines, Portugal 


## Project Background
This is an ongoing NEXUS Agenda project which focuses on the digital transition and decarbonisation of Sines Harbour, Portugal (NEXUS Agenda, 2023). Central to these objectives is the accurate determination of local wave parameters (wave height, Period, and direction), which are essential for supporting informed decision-making in coastal and harbour management. 

## Problem statement & Proposed solution 
Due to the deep bathymetry at the port of Sines, it is impossible to install a hydrodynamic sensor in the nearshore zone; therefore, it is essential to establish a cost-effective method that can effectively replace sensors. A method was developed using UAV images to estimate wave height (Hs_vid), which was validated using an ADCP at Figueira da Foz (reference). This method was replicated at the Port of Sines and compared with wave models data at different sea states (Hs_M1 to Hs_M2).
